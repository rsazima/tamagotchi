# tamagotchi

Tamagotchis are a small alien species that deposited an egg on Earth to see 
what life was like, and it is up to the player to raise the egg into an adult 
creature. The creature goes through several stages of growth, and will develop 
differently depending on the care the player provides.

Tamagotchi's go through several life cycles, most notably, egg, child, teen, 
adult, elderly. Tamagotchi's can die from lack of attention and also from age.
This specific lineage of Tamagotchis are capable of:

 - Aging from birth through to death
 - Losing health from hunger
 - Being fed
 - Being put to bed
 - Going to sleep on its own (after learning)
 - Pooping on its own without prompting (after learning)

Run the game with ```sbt run``` and folow the on-screen instruction.

Have fun!
